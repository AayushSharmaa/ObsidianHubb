# Seedbox

Based on the [[Digital garden]] analogy, [this post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-a-seedbox-is-and-why-it-has-been-valuable-to-me/) on the Obsidian forum introduced the concept of a seedbox:

> It’s an inbox with a nicer name and some methodology around it.
> ...
> In this metaphor, “seeds” are captured ideas. When you put a seed into your seedbox, you are “planting” it, in the hopes that it will grow into an Understanding. The thing is, when you plant a seed, you don’t really know what kind of plant it might grow up to be.

In short, our seedbox holds notes that were "planted" by a contributor who added some initial content, but might need a bit more time before they are "complete" (when the notes are linked, filled out, and/or filed in a suitable folder).
