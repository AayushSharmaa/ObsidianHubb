# 🗂️ Showcases & Templates

In this folder, you can find various examples and showcases how other people use [[🗂️ Plugin Showcases|specific plugins]], browse a vast collect of [[🗂️ Note Examples|Note Examples]], or how [[🗂️ Publish Sites|published vaults]] can look like. 

This channel is pretty much the equivalent of the `#snip-a-note` channel on Discord.

Got inspired or looking for something to get started? a collection of all sorts of [[🗂️ Templates]] can be found here as well.
