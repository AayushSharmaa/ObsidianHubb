# Don't ask to ask, just ask

**1. Don't ask**: 
> "Is there any JavaScript expert around?"

**2. Better ask**: 
>"Can someone explain to me why the following code does not sort the values as alphabetically?"

Question #2 is better for several reasons:
- The question #1 requires readers to self-evaluate whether they are an "expert", which is a pretty subjective assessment. Someone might be able to answer the question, but does not see themselves as an "expert". By asking the first question as opposed to the second, you'll miss answers from that type of person.
- Another problem of the first question is that it leaves it open how much of a time commitment it is to help out, as it's unclear whether it is a complicated problem or just a small request. Question number two, however, allows you to estimate how long it will take to help out. Generally, people are more willing to help if they can assess how much time it will take.
- Research on online communities has shown [that 80-90% of active members of an online community are lurkers](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/), i.e. people who mostly read along but don't participate in conversation. Those people are rather unlikely to respond to the first question, but might respond to the second one.
